# SINGLE_MD
<<<<<<< HEAD
A demonstration of molecular dynamics simulation of single particle based on Verlet algorithm, in which more than one noninteracting particle is possible. The algorithm is based on the verlet algorithm proposed in the paper "Accurate sampling using Langevin dynamics", Giovanni Bussi and Michele Parrinello, Phys. Rev. E 75, 056707 (2007).

To add one more dimension in z-direction:
(1) Add fz in field object and force object.
(2) Specify initial z positions and z velocities in configuration file.
